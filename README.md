# an rp2040 dev board

This is a dev board based upon the RP2040 microcontroller, a 32-bit dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+. This board comes with 16mb of flash memory, a 12 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB-C for power with a Low-Dropout Regulator, and light sensing capabilites enabled using a TSL25911FN. I made this because I was interested in the use of various components for general RP2040 based boards. This was also my first time making a microcontoller in general, and I learned much about the purpose of various IC's and passive components in the process!
